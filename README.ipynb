    "# Introduction\n",
    "This repository provides the Python library `ComCheb` for computing complex Chebyshev polynomials associated with a given contour or a Jordan domain, with the goal of reproducing and exploring results from the recently published preprint [1]. These polynomials are of great interest in approximation theory, numerical conformal mapping, and spectral methods on complex domains.\n",
    "To facilitate experimentation, the library also includes a collection of sample contours, all of which are presented and studied in [1]. The library includes two complementary implementations: one based on NumPy for fast and efficient double-precision computations, and another using mpmath, which supports arbitrary-precision arithmetic for high-accuracy calculations and validation.\n",
    "This project is intended for researchers, students, and practitioners working in numerical analysis, complex approximation, and computational mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us clarify the terminology and present the general problem addressed by this project. Given any compact set $K\\subset \\mathbb C$ we define the Chebyshev norm as $\\|f\\|_{K,\\infty}:=\\sup_{z\\in K}|f(z)|$. Assume that $K$ consists of infinitely many points, we then define the $n$-th Chebyshev polynomial to be the unique minimizer\n",
    "of\n",
    "$$\\underset{p\\in M_n}{\\mathrm{minimize}}\\ \\ \\|p\\|_{K,\\infty} \\tag{1}, $$\n",
    "where $M_n$ denotes the set of all complex monic polynomials of degree $n$. The aim of the project is to compute the Chebyshev polynomials in the special case where $K$ is either a contour or a domain whose boundary can be described by a contour. It is worth mentioning that the latter case can be reduced to the former, as polynomials are entire functions and therefore obtain their absolute maximum at the boundary of the given domain. In order to be precise, we define a contour $\\Gamma$ to be the image of a continuous function $\\gamma :[0,1]\\to\\mathbb C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The computational approach provided by this project follows the algorithm introduced by P.T.P. Tang [2], which was further refined by B. Fischer and J. Modersitzki in [3]. The procedure designed by Tang can be interpreted as a complex variant of the Remez algorithm, which computes the best uniform polynomial approximation for a given continuous function on any finite interval. Although Tang's algorithm is applicable in a more general context (i.e. computing best polynomial approximations of arbitrary continuous functions) this library is confined to the special case of computing the Chebyshev polynomials for any given contour. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us briefly break down the key concepts of Tang's algorithm (for a more detailed description see [2,3]). The procedure exploits a dual representation of (1). In fact, let the contour $\\Gamma$ be characterized by $\\gamma:[0,1]\\to\\mathbb C$, then it holds that\n",

    "Writing this in terms of matrices we have $A(\\mathbf t,\\mathbf \\alpha)r =(1,0,\\dots,0)\\in\\mathbb R^{2n+1}$ for some $\\mathbf t$ and $\\mathbf \\alpha$ depending matrix $A(\\mathbf t,\\mathbf \\alpha)$. Instead of solving (1) we aim to solve the right-hand side of (2), and recreate the $n$-th Chebyshev  polynomial $T_n^\\Gamma$  from the optimal parameters $\\mathbf t^*$ and $\\mathbf \\alpha^*$. If $\\mathbb A$ denotes the set of all pairs $(\\mathbf t,\\mathbf \\alpha)\\in [0,1]^{2n+1}\\times[0,2\\pi)^{2n+1}$ such that $A(\\mathbf t,\\mathbf \\alpha)$ is invertible, then there is a known continuous mapping $\\colon \\mathbb A \\to M_n$, $(\\mathbf t,\\mathbf \\alpha)\\mapsto p_{\\mathbf t,\\mathbf\\alpha}$ such that $ p_{\\mathbf t*,\\mathbf\\alpha^*}=T_n^\\Gamma$. Hence it remains to solve the right hand side of (2). Similar to the classical Remez algorithm, Tang's algorithm solves (2) in an iterative manner. The algorithm constructs a sequence of parameter pairs $(\\mathbf t^{(\\nu)},\\mathbf \\alpha^{(\\nu)})$ such that $h(\\mathbf t^{(\\nu)},\\mathbf \\alpha^{(\\nu)})$ is increasing in $\\nu$. This sequence usually converges fast towards the unique solution $(\\mathbf t^*,\\mathbf \\alpha^*)$. This iterative routine will be executed until $h(\\mathbf t^{(\\nu)},\\mathbf \\alpha^{(\\nu)})$ is positive and\n",

While using `mp` routines, make sure to feed the function either with string inputs like `'0.1'` or using the `mpf` data format provided by `mpmath`. All returned parameterizations are able to handle `floats`,`lists` and `numpy.ndarrays`, in addition the `mp` routines also handle `mpmath.matrix` inputs.\n",

    "The functions `Remez` and `mpRemez` call Tang's adaptation of the Remez algorithm. This algorithm computes the Chebyshev polynomial for any given continuous contour. Both variants work essentially the same, although `mpRemez` offers more optional arguments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these computations, especially in high-precision, are very expensive. To optimize efficiency we can exploit symmetries of the given contour. In fact, if the contour $\\Gamma$ is conjugate symmetric, that is $z \\in \\Gamma$ whenever $\\overline z\\in\\Gamma$, then coefficients of the $n$-th Chebyshev polynomial $T_n$ are real. Further, if $\\Gamma$ is $m$-rotational symmetric, that means that if $z\\in\\Gamma$ so are $e^{2\\pi ik/m} z$ for $k=1,\\dots,m-1$, then $T_n$ is of the form\n",
    "$$T_n(z)= z^\\ell Q_k(z^m) \\tag{5}$$\n",
    "for $n=km+\\ell$ and some monic polynomial $Q_k$ of degree $k$ see Lemma 3.1 of [1]. Thus, it is sufficient to use Tang's algorithm to find the polynomial $Q_k$ instead of $T_n$, which significantly speeds up the calculation. In the following, $m$ will denote the rotational symmetric constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Remez implementation offer the following input data:   \n",
    "- `gamma` : a parameterization $\\gamma:[0,1]\\to \\mathbb C$ of $\\Gamma$. Make sure, that $\\gamma$ is able to handle numpy array inputs, and in case of `mpmath` also the input of `mp.mpf`.\n",
    "- `N` : an integer, which describes the order $n$ of the wanted Chebyshev polynomial $T_n$.\n",
    "Further, these optional settings are available.\n",
    "- `t` : an array of $2k+1$ points in $[0,1]$.  The default is `None`, in this case random values are used. The array `t` will be used as initial parameter for $\\mathbf t^{(0)}$ according to Section 1.\n",
    "- `a` : an array of $2k+1$ points in $[0,2\\pi)$. The default is `None`, in this case random values are used. The array `a` will be used as initial parameter for $\\mathbf \\alpha^{(0)}$ according to Section 1.\n",
    "- `rc` : a boolean, default is `False`. It is short for 'real coefficients'. Set this to  `True`, whenever $\\Gamma$ is conjugate symmetric.\n",
    "- `symmetry` : integer. This value defines the rotational symmetry $m$. Use this, whenever $\\Gamma$ is $m$-rotational symmtric. This setting greatly improves the performance.\n",
    "- `prec` : an float (default 1e-10). This defines the wanted accuracy according to (3) and (4).\n",
    "- `maxit` : integer, determines the maximum number of iterations for the Remez routine.\n",
    "- `plot` : bool (default `False`). If `True`, then a plot will be created showing on the left the absolute value of the computed Chebyshev polynomial and on the right the relative error according to (3) with respect to the iteration number.\n",
    "- `pinfo`: bool (default `False`). This is short for 'print info'. If set to `True` then additional information are printed while the Remez routine is running. Within the printed data `h_p` refers to $\\|p_{\\mathbf t^{(\\nu)},\\mathbf \\alpha^{(\\nu)}}\\|_{\\Gamma,\\infty}$ and `h_D` denotes the value for $h(\\mathbf t^{(\\nu)},\\mathbf \\alpha ^{(\\nu)})$, both with respect to the notation in Section 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the routine `mpRemez` offers the additional parameters `samples` (integer with default `1001`) and `reps` (integer with default `10`). These are used for determining the maximum of $|p_{\\mathbf t^{(\\nu)},\\mathbf \\alpha^{(\\nu)}}\\circ \\gamma|$.  We first discretise [0,1] at `samples`-many equidistant points $\\{x_0,\\dots\\}$, then we take the value $x_k$ for which the given function is maximal. We refine the the approximate maximum $x_k$ by discretizing $[x_{k-1},x_{k+1}]$ into 201 equidistant points. We repeat this refining process `reps`-times. It is suggested to set `reps`$\\approx-\\log_{10}($`prec`) to ensure an accurate result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Remez routines will provide the following output:\n",
    "- `t` : numpy array containing the reference points $\\mathbf t \\in [0,1]^{2k+1}$ according to Section 1 applied to the function $Q_k$ as in (5).\n",
    "- `a` : numpy array containing the angles $\\mathbf \\alpha \\in [0,2\\pi)^{2k+1}$ according to Section 1 applied to the  function $Q_k$ as in (5).\n",

    "- `rel_err` : `float` or `mp.mpf` describing the achieved relative error according to (3) and (4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, if one wants to evaluate the determined Chebyshev polynomial, it has to be reconstructed using (5). Since the returned coefficients are given with respect to $Q_k$ and not the Chebyshev polynomial $T_n$. The easiest way to do so is to invoke the function `Cheby` described later.\n",
